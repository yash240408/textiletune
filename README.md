# Textile Calculator App [TextileTune]

Welcome to the Textile Calculator app, an open-source project designed to simplify unit conversions in the textile industry. This Flutter-based mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for converting between various textile units, making it a valuable tool for professionals and enthusiasts alike.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter (mobile app framework)
- **Backend:** (Optional) Choose based on data storage needs:
  - Local Storage: SharedPreferences (built-in Flutter package) for basic values like recently used conversions.
  - Remote Database: Cloud Firestore (NoSQL database) for storing user-specific conversion history or complex conversion configurations.

## Non-Technical Languages

Developers contributing to this project should have a thorough understanding of:

- **Textile Unit System:** Familiarity with units used in different stages of textile production, such as yarn count, fabric weight, etc.
- **Conversion Formulas:** Knowledge of accurate conversion formulas between various textile units.
- **User Interface Design:** Design skills to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the app.

## Features

1. **Unit Conversion:** Convert between commonly used textile units.
2. **Material Selection:** Allow users to select the type of textile (yarn, fabric, etc.) for accurate conversion.
3. **Recent Conversions (Optional):** Display a list of recent conversions for quick reference.
4. **Conversion History (Optional):** Store user-specific conversion history for future reference (requires remote database).
5. **Customization (Optional):** Allow users to define custom conversion formulas or units (requires advanced user interface and data management).

## Data Storage (Optional)

- **Variables:** For basic user input and temporary calculations. Store recently used values like current textile type, selected units, and conversion results.
- **Database:** If you want to store user-specific conversion history or offer complex features like custom formulas, consider using a remote database like Cloud Firestore. This allows users to access their data across devices and provides better scalability.

## Additional Tips

- **Offer Offline Functionality:** Allow users to convert units even without an internet connection by storing conversion formulas locally.
- **Integrate Unit Calculators:** Consider integrating additional calculators relevant to the textile industry, like fabric yield or fiber strength calculations.
- **Provide Educational Resources:** Add informative sections explaining different textile units and their applications.
